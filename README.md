# Rick and Morty API Viewer

This project is a web application that retrieves information from the Rick and Morty API. It is built using Angular and showcases my skills in frontend development, including lazy loading, API calls validation, modularization, services, responsive design using Bootstrap, absolute routing using aliases, and maintaining clean and scalable code.

# Project Deployment

The project is currently hosted at https://josepabloponce.github.io/Rick-And-Morty-Wiki/home. You can visit this link to access the deployed version of the application and explore its features.

## Features

- Lazy Loading: The application utilizes lazy loading to optimize performance by loading modules on demand, improving initial load time and reducing resource consumption.

- API Calls Validation: All API requests are properly validated to handle errors, timeouts, and unexpected responses, ensuring a smooth user experience.

- Modularization: The project is structured into separate modules, allowing for better organization, encapsulation, and maintainability. Each module represents a distinct feature or functionality.

- Services: Services are used to encapsulate API calls, data manipulation, and business logic. They provide a centralized and reusable way to manage data and communication between components.

- Responsive Design: Bootstrap is integrated into the project to create responsive and mobile-friendly components, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

- Absolute Routing with Aliases: The project uses aliases to enable absolute path routing, making the code more maintainable and readable. Aliases provide a clear and concise way to reference different parts of the project without relying on relative paths.

- Shared Components: The shared folder contains reusable components that can be easily used across multiple modules. This promotes code reusability and reduces duplication.

- Interfaces: Interfaces are utilized to define the structure and shape of data objects, ensuring consistency and providing a clear contract for data manipulation and communication.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates my proficiency in Angular development, showcasing key features such as lazy loading, API calls validation, modularization, services, responsive design using Bootstrap, absolute routing with aliases, shared components, and interfaces. It reflects my commitment to writing clean, scalable, and maintainable code.
